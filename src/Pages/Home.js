        <h3>Cryptozoology and "Cryptids"</h3>
        <p>Cryptozoology is a pseudoscience and subculture dedicated to the search for and study of unknown, legendary, or extinct animals whose current existence is questioned or unverified.<br/> 
        It focuses particularly on creatures popular in folklore, like Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, Yeti, the chupacabra, the Jersey Devil, or the Mokele-mbembe. <br/> Practitioners of cryptozoology term these creatures "cryptids."
        </p>
        <p>Cryptozoology is widely considered a pseudoscience within mainstream scientific circles due to its deviation from the scientific method. Consequently, it often <br/> encounters significant skepticism and is frequently disregarded, not being taken seriously by the scientific community. However, it's worth noting that history has shown instances<br/> where creatures initially dismissed as extinct or mere products of folklore were later proven to be real.<br/>
        Some of these animals are: Komodo Dragon, giant squid, Mountain Gorilla, Coelacanth, and Okapi.</p>
